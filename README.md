# UFO Sightings

Overview:
For this project I built a preliminary webpage showing a documented list of recorded UFO sightings. 

Results:
This is a very easy website to use. There is only one page (thus far) that automatically displays a table of all the recorded sightings. Users can filter the table by one or up to four different variables. The variables are dates, locations by city, state, and country, as well as the shape the UFO took.

As you can see from the second image each text input box has placeholder text already within the boxes, this is to help users understand the formatting used when inputting text. For dates, it follows a Month/Day/Year format, whereas with states and countries you use the two letter abbreviation, i.e. CA for California, and US for United States. This however, could cause confusion, as CA is also used for Canada.

Summary:

This webpage is incredibly user friendly, however I think some aspects are overly simplified. I mentioned earlier the drawbacks of using the two letter abreviations for both State and Country (and not to mention many countries don't divide into states). I would edit the site to display either a 3 letter abreviation for countries, i.e. USA, CAN, or even using a drop down menu. I would also add a section for users to record their own UFO sightings, as well as a section to display photos of said sightings (if available).
